############ 2016-02-15 ##############
Meeting with Xuelai

Plan discussion:
1. 3D reconstruction from 2 images
2. 3D reconstruction from multiple images
3. Optimize step 2 with BA
4. Using images from UAV

Subplan discussion of step 1:
1. Camera calibration
2. Image read-in
3. Preprocessing - Undistortion
4. Feature detection
5. Feature matching
6. Compute F Matrix with RANSAC
7. Compute camera poses R, t
8. Dense feature points matching
9. Projection Matrix
10. Triangulation
11. Get color
12. Scaling
13. RViz visualization

Division and Cooperation:
Base: Github
Shared programming
Program efficiency test by Xuelai

Meeting with Shen and Xuelai

Questions:
1. How to go from Sparse to dense
A: Do rectification on a stereo pair of images s.t. their epipolar lines are horizontal. (2D -> 1D search). Take one feature in the first image and search for match in the second on epipolar line. Need to be the only match.

2. GPU programming
A: OpenCV has a library in C. A namespace. Recommended personnels: Ling Yonggen, Yang Zhenfei.

3. VO on multiple images. Compare in 2-by-2 way?
A: Fix one image and search for features. Then match all images with the chosen image.

4. Need for GPS?
A: With GPS at this stage.

############ 2016-02-24 ############
Meeting with Shen

Questions:
1. How to detect loop closure
A: Simplify front-end problem at this stage. No loop closures, no data structure. E.g. Take 10 images next to each other and use the middle image.

2. Do RANSAC for all pairs of images that used surf?
A: Yes.

3. Initial values of 3D points coordinates comes from the first two images?
A: Yes. Use 2D to 2D projection in the first match, and use 3D to 2D projection for future matching. It preserves the scale for other images.

4. Real time BA?
A: Pass.
